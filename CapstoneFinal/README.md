#Capstone

#Definitely the toughest project to have ever attempted. Really pushed the limits of my knowledge with github. Had to restart repo due to mistakes when pushing/pulling and attempts to resolve. Finally somewhat understand the steps.

#Thank you FSA as well as Aisha, Chuck, and Woody for your guidance through these past seven months!

#Thank you all peers that I worked with and helped review, revise, and contribute suggestions for completion.
